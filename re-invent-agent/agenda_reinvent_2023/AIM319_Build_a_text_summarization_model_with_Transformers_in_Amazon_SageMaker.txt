In this workshop, use a pretrained Transformer model for summarization, fine-tune the model on your own dataset to improve performance, deploy the trained model for inference, evaluate the model using advanced decoding techniques like beam search and sampling, and discuss best practices for generating high-quality summaries. Get hands-on experience training, deploying, and evaluating a Transformer-based summarization model. Explore ways to use the power of Transformers to extract concise summaries from large volumes of text.
