These new capabilities enable a single controller to distribute its workload across multiple replicas, reducing the performance constraint on the system through full horizontal scalability. Furthermore, this talk demonstrates how you can achieve better compute performance at scale for CI/CD workloads running on CloudBees CI using Arm-based AWS Graviton3 processors as a foundation.
