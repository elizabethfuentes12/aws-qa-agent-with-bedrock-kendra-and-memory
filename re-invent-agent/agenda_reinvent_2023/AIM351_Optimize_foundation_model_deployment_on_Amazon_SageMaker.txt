Larger models are often more accurate because they include billions of parameters, but their size can also result in slower inference latency or worse throughput. Hosting an FM can require more GPU memory and optimized kernels to achieve acceptable performance. In this workshop, learn how to choose the right container and instance types, optimize container parameters, set up the right auto scaling policies, and use APIs to get recommendations with Amazon SageMaker.
