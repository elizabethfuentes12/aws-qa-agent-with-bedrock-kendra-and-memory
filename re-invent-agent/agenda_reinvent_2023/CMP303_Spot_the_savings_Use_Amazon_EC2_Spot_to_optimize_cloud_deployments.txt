EC2 Spot enables you to optimize your costs and scale your application’s throughput. In this workshop, learn about the APIs and commands used to create EC2 Spot Instances. Create an EC2 launch template and use the template to launch EC2 Spot Instances with EC2 Auto Scaling groups, EC2 Spot Fleet, EC2 Fleet, and the EC2 RunInstances API. Also find out how you can implement Spot functions such as Spot placement scores, attribute-based instance selection, and AWS Fault Injection Simulator (AWS FIS).
