This workshop teaches you how to use Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs to implement the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm to compute the potential energy surface for the hydrogen molecule. In this hands-on workshop, set up your Braket notebooks and run Hybrid Jobs on real quantum hardware. You will leave with code examples that you can use as a foundation for your own projects. You must bring your laptop to participate., sessiontype :Workshop, venuename :Caesars Forum, floorplanname :Level 1, locationname :Summit 216, startdatetimeutc :November, 29 2023 20:00:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 29 2023 22:00:00 -0500,
