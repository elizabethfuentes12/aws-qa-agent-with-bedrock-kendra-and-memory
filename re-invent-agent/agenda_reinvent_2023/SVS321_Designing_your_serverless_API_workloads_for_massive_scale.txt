This chalk talk discusses key design principles for Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB to achieve massive scale. See a demo of how asynchronous processing, caching, rate limiting, and performance optimization can help you architect workloads to withstand large bursts of traffic. We apply these principles to evolve a real-world architecture while holding an in-depth Q&A., sessiontype :Chalk Talk, venuename :MGM Grand, floorplanname :Level 3, locationname :301, startdatetimeutc :November, 29 2023 20:00:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 29 2023 21:00:00 -0500,
