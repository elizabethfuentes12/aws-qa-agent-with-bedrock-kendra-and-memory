[REPEAT], description :Many organizations choose AWS Fargate for its simplicity and ease of use because it removes the operational overhead of managing Amazon EC2 instances. However, some users ask how moving to Fargate affects the workload. In this workshop, explore the CPU, memory request, and limit settings on Amazon EC2 compared to Fargate to help determine the right launch type for your workload. Learn the difference in behavior when a workload operates outside the requested resources. Dive deep by simulating real-world application behavior through synthetic load generation.
