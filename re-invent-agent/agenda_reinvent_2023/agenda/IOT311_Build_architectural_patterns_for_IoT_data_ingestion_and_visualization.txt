However, the key to gaining insights, improving operational efficiency, and achieving business outcomes lies in an appropriate reporting and visualization solution. No single solution fits every use case. You may require real-time data delivery, while others need a fully customizable solution with search capabilities. In this workshop, learn about the different IoT reporting and visualization solutions at AWS. This workshop examines seven architectural patterns for real-time, near real-time, and scheduled reporting and provides data points for use cases, refresh intervals, data ingestion, architecture, and solution complexity. You must bring your laptop to participate., sessiontype :Workshop, venuename :MGM Grand, floorplanname :Level 1, locationname :Grand 113, startdatetimeutc :November, 28 2023 19:00:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 28 2023 21:00:00 -0500,
