In this session, learn how to use shadow traffic and unique capabilities of the cloud to migrate petabytes of data and millions of requests per second safely and without any risk of data loss or user-visible performance regression. By ensuring all operations are idempotent, using the cloud to launch shadow hardware, and duplicating traffic while processing idempotent backfills, organizations can help ensure safe upgrades., sessiontype :Breakout Session, venuename :Mandalay Bay, floorplanname :Level 2 | South, locationname :Oceanside C, startdatetimeutc :November, 29 2023 17:00:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 29 2023 18:00:00 -0500,
