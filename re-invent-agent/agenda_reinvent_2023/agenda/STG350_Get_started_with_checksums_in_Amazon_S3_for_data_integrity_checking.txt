As assets are migrated and used across workflows, it’s important to ensure files remain unaltered by network corruption, hard drive failure, or other issues. Algorithms are used to scan files byte by byte to generate unique fingerprints, known as checksums. In this follow-up demonstration to STG201, learn how to use checksums to verify that assets are not altered when copied. Explore Amazon S3 checksum options for accelerating data integrity checking.
