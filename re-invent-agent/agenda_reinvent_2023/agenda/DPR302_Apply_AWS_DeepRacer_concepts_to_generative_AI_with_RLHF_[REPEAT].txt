Taking it a step further, RL paired with generative AI has revolutionized how humans interact with machines—using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). RLHF focuses on how AI agents can learn from human feedback. In this workshop, explore AWS generative AI offerings, RLHF, and its use cases. You also have the opportunity to fine-tune a foundation model on a custom dataset using RLHF.
