They have several emerging data patterns including in-context learning, model fine-tuning, and build your own model. This is just the beginning. These applications require high-quality data and a solid data foundation to operate on. The building blocks of this data foundation include batch and real-time data pipelines, data governance, and vector data management, tailored to custom needs.
