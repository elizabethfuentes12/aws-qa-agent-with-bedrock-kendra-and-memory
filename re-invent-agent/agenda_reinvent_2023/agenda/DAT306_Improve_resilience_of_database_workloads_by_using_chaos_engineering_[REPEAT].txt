Recreating real-world failure conditions helps uncover hidden bugs as well as monitoring omissions and performance bottlenecks. This builders’ session helps you build a standard architectural pattern for injecting failures and experiments for chaos engineering on Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS database instances to test for high availability. Learn how to use the AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS), a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments on AWS, to run complex scenarios with common system failures.
