Organizations spend time extracting and normalizing data and performing feature engineering for text, image, or tabular data, which can take weeks. With Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, you can connect to more than 40 data sources and simplify the process of data preparation and feature engineering. In this chalk talk, learn how to accelerate the data preparation workflow, including data selection, cleansing, exploration, bias detection, visualization, and transformation from a single visual interface. Once your data preparation is ready, learn how to process petabytes of data and automate the data preparation workflow with a few clicks., sessiontype :Chalk Talk, venuename :MGM Grand, floorplanname :Level 3, locationname :Premier 320, startdatetimeutc :November, 30 2023 02:00:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 30 2023 03:00:00 -0500,
