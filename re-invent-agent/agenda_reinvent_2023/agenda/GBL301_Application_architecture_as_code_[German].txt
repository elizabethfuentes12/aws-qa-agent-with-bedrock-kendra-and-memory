Cloud automation can do more than reduce the toil of provisioning or configuring compute infrastructure. With application-level services that orchestrate, transform, store, and route events, it can also define your application topology. By describing component granularity, dependencies, data and control flow, and degrees of coupling in executable automation code, you can redefine automation from infrastructure as code to architecture as code. This talk takes AWS CDK to the next level and provides a novel take on automation at the intersection of serverless, integration, abstraction, and design patterns, with a special emphasis on the lines, not just the boxes., sessiontype :Lightning Talk, venuename :Venetian, floorplanname :Level 2, locationname :Hall B, Expo, Theater 1, Booth #422, Infrastructure Solutions Zone, startdatetimeutc :November, 29 2023 20:30:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 29 2023 20:50:00 -0500,
