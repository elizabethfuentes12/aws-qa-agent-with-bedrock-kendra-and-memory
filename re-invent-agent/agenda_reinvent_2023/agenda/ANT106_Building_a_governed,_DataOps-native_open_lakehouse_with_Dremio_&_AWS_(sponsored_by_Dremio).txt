However, the challenges of maintaining multiple environments, complex data operations, and time-consuming data optimization strategies still exist. In this lightning talk, learn about Dremio Arctic, a data lakehouse management service that provides “git-like” version control on data, which enables using one environment for all types of workloads. Also learn about Apache Iceberg, an open table format with branching and tagging capabilities. AWS Lake Formation will then be introduced to apply governance for the open lakehouse solution.
