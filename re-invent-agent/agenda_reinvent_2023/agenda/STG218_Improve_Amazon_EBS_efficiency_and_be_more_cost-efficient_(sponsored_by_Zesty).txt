On Amazon EC2-connected Amazon EBS volumes, they had petabytes of provisioned storage, but average disk utilization was 20%, leaving them paying hundreds of thousands for provisioned capacity that rarely was used. In this session, learn how you can achieve greater efficiency with fewer storage resources. Hear how Securonix used Zesty to reduce the monthly amount of provisioned data by over 80%, translating to thousands of dollars saved each month.
