Stable Diffusion models can be fine-tuned and deployed using AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia2, which provide up to 50% savings on training costs and up to 40% lower cost per inference. In this workshop, learn how to fine-tune a leading Stable Diffusion model on Trainium and then deploy it on Inferentia2 to create a custom character. The session covers how to use the Optimum Neuron interface from Hugging Face to generate 1,000 images for under 50 cents.
