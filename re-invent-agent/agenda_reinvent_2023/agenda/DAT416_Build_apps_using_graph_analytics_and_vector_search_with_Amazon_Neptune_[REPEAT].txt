Performing analytics over these graphs allows you to discover new information, like who the threat actors are and where the security risks might be. Come watch experts live code a sample security graph application in Amazon Neptune that invokes graph algorithms and utilizes vector similarity search to perform Retrieval Augmented Generation. Also, see live code examples for integrating Neptune with LangChain to do prompt-based graph query generation, and learn how to use the recently launched Neptune data API., sessiontype :Code Talk, venuename :Wynn, floorplanname :Level 1, locationname :Lafite 2, startdatetimeutc :November, 30 2023 21:00:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 30 2023 22:00:00 -0500,
