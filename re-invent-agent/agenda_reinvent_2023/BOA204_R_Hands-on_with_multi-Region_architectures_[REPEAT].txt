Multi-Region active/standby architectures give you a variety of options to meet your recovery time and recovery point objectives for business continuity. These options include AWS CloudFormation StackSets to deploy your infrastructure, cross-Region replication, and multi-Region access points with Amazon S3 to make your data available worldwide. In this chalk talk, see how to build a complete architecture using many of the tools and features that AWS offers. Artifacts are provided to help you experiment with these solutions.
