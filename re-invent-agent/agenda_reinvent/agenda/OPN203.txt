In this session, explore how you can use the power of these models to become more productive. Learn from several use cases, including code refactoring, debugging, code explanation, and answering common questions, about how Jupyter AI can answer questions based on user input, help explain and fix code errors, and learn from and answer questions about local data files. Announced at JupyterCon 2023, Jupyter AI is available as free, open source software., sessiontype :Breakout Session, venuename :MGM Grand, floorplanname :Level 1, locationname :Grand 120, startdatetimeutc :November, 27 2023 22:30:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 27 2023 23:30:00 -0500,
