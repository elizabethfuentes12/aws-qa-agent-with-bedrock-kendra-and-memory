However, it can be simplified with AWS Step Functions Distributed Map state. During this session, learn how to build a data processing or other automation once and readily scale it to thousands of parallel processes with serverless technologies. Explore how this approach simplifies development and error handling while improving speed and lowering cost. Hear from an AWS customer that refactored an existing machine learning application to use Distributed Map and the lessons they learned along the way., sessiontype :Breakout Session, venuename :Mandalay Bay, floorplanname :Level 2 | South, locationname :Oceanside B, startdatetimeutc :November, 30 2023 22:00:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 30 2023 23:00:00 -0500,
