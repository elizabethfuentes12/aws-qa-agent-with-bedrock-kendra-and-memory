The evolution from monolithic structures to microservices, message pipelines, third-party integrations, containers, and Kubernetes orchestration has increased complexity, raising the question of whether we should develop locally using mocks. Do we use remote development, much to the dismay of many developers? Or, do we combine local and remote assets?
