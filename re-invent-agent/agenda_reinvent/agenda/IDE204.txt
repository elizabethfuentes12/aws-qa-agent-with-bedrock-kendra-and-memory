Its impact spans from measuring ocean tides to tracking the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In this lightning talk, hear about Nixtla’s TimeGPT, the first pretrained foundation model for time series forecasting that can produce accurate predictions across a diverse array of domains and applications without additional training. A general pretrained model constitutes a groundbreaking innovation that opens the path to a new paradigm for the forecasting practice that is more accessible and accurate, is less time-consuming, and drastically reduces computational complexity., sessiontype :Lightning Talk, venuename :Venetian, floorplanname :Level 2, locationname :Hall B, Expo, Theater 3, Booth #1480, Developer Solutions Zone, startdatetimeutc :November, 30 2023 21:00:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 30 2023 21:20:00 -0500,
