However, to best take advantage of generative AI, you need an effective data strategy. Foundation models and other large language models need data to deliver a domain-specific experience, whether for in-context learning, fine-tuning, or training purposes. In this session, learn how to formulate an effective data strategy; use AWS data services, such as Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS, Amazon OpenSearch Service, and many others, to build generative AI applications; and accelerate your efforts using data-centric architectural patterns., sessiontype :Breakout Session, venuename :Mandalay Bay, floorplanname :Level 3 | South, locationname :Jasmine F, startdatetimeutc :November, 27 2023 21:30:00 -0500, enddatetimeutc :November, 27 2023 22:30:00 -0500,
