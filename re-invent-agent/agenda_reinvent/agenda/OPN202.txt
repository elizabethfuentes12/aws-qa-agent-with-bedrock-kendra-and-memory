However, the lack of a shell shouldn’t stop you from shipping and aggregating log data! This workshop describes Bottlerocket, its architecture, and a Kubernetes technique (using container fundamentals) that you can use to set up logging using Fluent Bit and send logs to OpenSearch without ever touching the shell. The workshop also demonstrates how you can use OpenSearch to analyze these logs and gain insights into the health and status of the worker nodes.
