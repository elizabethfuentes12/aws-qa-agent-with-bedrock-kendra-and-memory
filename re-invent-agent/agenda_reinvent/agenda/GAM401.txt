To use applications in production, infrastructure teams need to continuously integrate, deploy, and fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) that support generative AI applications. In this workshop, learn how to operationalize text and image generation applications on AWS using the principles of LLM operations (LLMOps) for continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous tuning (CI/CD/CT). This workshop provides the infrastructure code necessary to get started with building generative AI applications.
