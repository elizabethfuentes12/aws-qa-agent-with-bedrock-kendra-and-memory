However, it can be too rigid for today’s diverse and dynamic data needs. Facing challenges of flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency at scale, organizations are turning to the modern data lake as an upgrade from the modern data stack. In this lightning talk, learn how the modern data lake offers an open, future-proof alternative for organizations to derive richer insights from all of their data. Whether the use is data science and AI/ML workloads or driving forward analytics, the answer is the modern data lake.
